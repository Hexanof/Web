										<p>GitHub is a great tool for those starting out in programming. It allows you to host projects online for free, although there are some conditions to be aware of. For example, there are limitations on space or request numbers, but it’s still more than enough to get started. Moreover, it makes collaboration with other developers easy, tracks project changes, and provides a history of all modifications. All in all, it’s a must-have for anyone wanting to share and manage their code online!</p>

												<p>As part of my learning and integration of a database, I used MySQL, and I find it to be an excellent tool for connecting and managing databases in a simple and efficient way. Thanks to its popularity and robustness, MySQL offers a reliable and high-performance solution for creating, manipulating, and querying databases.</p>
												<p>One of MySQL's major advantages is its ability to integrate easily into applications, whether using languages like PHP, Python, or JavaScript. It handles SQL queries efficiently and provides excellent performance even with large datasets. In short, MySQL is an essential choice for anyone developing an application with a reliable and accessible database.</p>
